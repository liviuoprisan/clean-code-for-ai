# Clean Code Principles for AI

Clean code rules for AI coding assistants. Teaches agents to write maintainable code focused on simplicity, small functions, and clear naming.

## How to Use

Copy [`clean-code.md`](clean-code.md) to:

**Cursor:** `.cursor/rules/clean-code.md` in your project root
Some versions of Cursor seem to prefer the file to be .mdc instead of .md.

**Claude Code:**
- Project: `.claude/rules/clean-code.md`
- User-level: `~/.claude/rules/clean-code.md` (applies to all your projects)

**Test**
Ask the AI "do you have the clean code rules in your context?"
